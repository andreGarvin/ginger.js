## IDK.JS
A small stupid JavaScript framework I made for out of boredom.

# Why did I make it ?
I made this framework/library because I was very curious on how to make a libray like jquery but some cool react-ish like component stuff. Also I wa tried of playing persona 5 for while.

# Documenatation
The doumentation is in the code but I will probably make a github page for the project and the documentation when I ahve the chance.

# Contributing ?
I invite everyone to contribute to this project and I am very open to new ideas and thoughts in who the projects works/looks. So send a PR about anything related to the project and also make the fucntion names funny when you create them lol.
